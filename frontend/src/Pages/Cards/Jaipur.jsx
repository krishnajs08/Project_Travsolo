          <p>
          Jaipur is the capital of India‚Äôs Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or ‚ÄúPink City‚Äù for its trademark building color. At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens, courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence.
          </p>

          <h3 id="history">History</h3>
          <p>
          Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan, is famously known as the "Pink City" and boasts a rich history deeply rooted in royal grandeur and architectural brilliance. Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur was meticulously planned as India‚Äôs first well-designed city. The Maharaja, a visionary leader and an astronomer, built the city based on Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra principles, ensuring a harmonious balance between aesthetics and functionality. The city was laid out in a grid system with wide streets and distinct zones for commercial, residential, and administrative purposes, making it a marvel of urban planning. The iconic pink color, which symbolizes hospitality, was introduced in 1876 during the visit of Prince Albert of Wales, giving Jaipur its nickname.
          </p>
          <p>
          The city‚Äôs history is intertwined with its stunning architecture and cultural heritage. Landmarks like the Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar (an astronomical observatory and a UNESCO World Heritage site), and City Palace reflect the blend of Rajput, Mughal, and European architectural styles. Jaipur was not only a hub of trade and culture but also a center of arts, with the royals promoting crafts like gemstone cutting, block printing, and jewelry making. Today, Jaipur stands as a vibrant testament to its royal past, seamlessly blending tradition and modernity, making it a cherished destination for history, culture, and architecture enthusiasts.
