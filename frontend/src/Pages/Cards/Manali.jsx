          <p>Manali is a resort town, near Kullu town in Kullu district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It is situated in the northern end of the Kullu Valley, formed by the Beas River. The town is located in the Kullu district, approximately 270 kilometres (170 mi) north of the state capital of Shimla and 544 kilometres (338 mi) northeast of the national capital of New Delhi. With a population of 8,096 people recorded in the 2011 Indian census Manali is the beginning of an ancient trade route through Lahaul (H.P.) and Ladakh, over the Karakoram Pass and onto Yarkand and Hotan in the Tarim Basin of China. Manali is a popular tourist destination in India and serves as the gateway to the Lahaul and Spiti district as well as the city of Leh in Ladakh.</p>
          <br />
          <h3 id="history">History</h3>
          <p>Manali is named after Manu, the progenitor of humanity in Hinduism. The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of Manu-Alaya (transl. 'the abode of Manu'). In Hindu cosmology, Manu is believed to have stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world at the end of an cyclic age. The Kullu Valley in which Manali is situated is often referred to as the "Valley of the Gods". An old village in the town has an ancient temple dedicated to the sage Manu.</p>
        <p>Historically, the Kullu Valley, including Manali, was part of the ancient "Satluj Corridor," an important trade route connecting India with Central Asia and Tibet. During medieval times, Manali served as a vital stopover for merchants and travelers journeying through passes like Rohtang and Lahaul. The valley was ruled by the Kullu kings, who were known for their patronage of art, culture, and religion, as seen in architectural marvels like the Hidimba Devi Temple, built in the 16th century.</p>
